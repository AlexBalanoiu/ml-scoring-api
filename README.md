# Loan Risk Scoring API

A production-style REST API built with FastAPI that evaluates loan applications and returns a risk score and category.

## Features

- `POST /predict` – scores a loan application
- `GET /health` – health check endpoint
- Pydantic v2 input validation with descriptive error messages
- Weighted scoring formula based on credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and age
- Logging to both console and file
- Fully configurable via environment variables
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## Risk Scoring Formula

The risk score is a weighted sum of three normalized components:

| Component | Weight | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Credit Score | 40% | Higher score → lower risk |
| Debt-to-Income Ratio | 35% | `loan_amount / income`, capped at 10x |
| Age | 25% | Parabolic curve, lowest risk around age 35–45 |

**Categories:**
- `LOW` → score < 0.3
- `MEDIUM` → 0.3 ≤ score < 0.7
- `HIGH` → score ≥ 0.7

## Quick Start (local)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API docs available at: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
docker build -t loan-scoring-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 loan-scoring-api
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age": 35, "income": 50000, "loan_amount": 10000, "credit_score": 680}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "risk_score": 0.3521,
  "risk_category": "MEDIUM"
}
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_PORT` | `8000` | Server port |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level |
| `LOG_FILE` | `logs/app.log` | Log file path |
| `LOW_THRESHOLD` | `0.3` | Score below this → LOW |
| `HIGH_THRESHOLD` | `0.7` | Score above this → HIGH |
| `WEIGHT_CREDIT_SCORE` | `0.4` | Weight for credit score component |
| `WEIGHT_DEBT_RATIO` | `0.35` | Weight for debt-to-income component |
| `WEIGHT_AGE` | `0.25` | Weight for age component |
